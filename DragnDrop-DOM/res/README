Storing Editor Metadata:
========================

Objects holding Flerdit metadata (such as X/Y positions of objects) need to be
stored with a domain identifier of "Flerdit,2012". Type identifiers can be
arbitrary, such as "Position". The prototype will ignore any objects in the
"Flerdit,2012" domain.

All YAML files in this directory archive have an example entry in the
"Flerdit,2012" domain at the end.
